Make sure to replace `anveshana/frontend/` and `anveshana/backend/main/` with the actual paths where your React and Go projects are located, respectively.

This `README.md` provides a basic guide to start the application in a development environment. For a production setup, you'd need additional steps for building and deploying both the front-end and the back-end, along with environment-specific configurations.
